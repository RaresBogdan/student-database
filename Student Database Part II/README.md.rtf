# Student Database Part II\
\
This repository contains the SQL scripts and shell scripts that I created to build and manipulate a student database using PostgreSQL. This project showcases my skills and knowledge in SQL and shell scripting.\
\
## Project Description\
\
The student database is a relational database that stores information about students, courses, grades, instructors, and departments. The database has the following tables:\
\
- students: stores the student id, name, email, and phone number\
- courses: stores the course id, name, description, and credits\
- grades: stores the student id, course id, grade, and date\
- instructors: stores the instructor id, name, email, and phone number\
- departments: stores the department id, name, and budget\
- course_instructors: stores the course id and instructor id\
- course_departments: stores the course id and department id\
\
The SQL scripts in the `sql` folder perform various tasks on the database, such as:\
\
- Creating and dropping tables, views, indexes, and constraints\
- Inserting, updating, and deleting data\
- Joining tables using different types of joins\
- Using aggregate functions and subqueries to calculate statistics\
- Using conditional expressions and case statements to control the flow of queries\
- Using triggers and stored procedures to automate tasks and enforce business rules\
\
The shell scripts in the `sh` folder interact with the PostgreSQL database server, such as:\
\
- Logging in and out of the database\
- Listing the databases and tables\
- Connecting to a specific database\
- Running a SQL script from a file\
- Executing a SQL command from the command line\
- Displaying the student information based on user input\
\
## How to Run the Scripts\
\
To run the SQL scripts, you need to have PostgreSQL installed on your system. You can download it from [here].\
\
To run the shell scripts, you need to have a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or macOS. You also need to have psql command-line tool installed.\
\
To run the scripts, follow these steps:\
\
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/student-database-part-2.git`\
2. Change your current directory to the repository using `cd student-database-part-2`\
3. Start the PostgreSQL server using `sudo service postgresql start`\
4. Create a database user named `student` with password `student` using `sudo -u postgres createuser -P student`\
5. Create a database named `students` owned by `student` using `sudo -u postgres createdb -O student students`\
6. Run the SQL scripts in the `sql` folder using `psql -U student -d students -f sql/<script-name>.sql`\
7. Run the shell scripts in the `sh` folder using `./sh/<script-name>.sh`\
8. Stop the PostgreSQL server using `sudo service postgresql stop`}
